## kio fork direction

This fork keeps Gito as the review engine and adds `kio`, a local PR review
orchestrator for the `kiodreambau` GitHub account. The first MVP target is a
Mac-local worker that reacts only when `kiodreambau` is requested as a GitHub
reviewer. The PR label `kio:1` through `kio:4` selects review depth before the
reviewer request. KIO runs the configured backend locally, stores the run under
`~/kio/runs`, submits one transparent native GitHub review, and can send an
outbound completion email or Slack notification.

The upstream `gito` CLI is intentionally kept intact for now. New local-worker
behavior lives in the `kio` package and is documented in
[`documentation/kio_mvp.md`](documentation/kio_mvp.md).

> 🚀 More platforms and integrations are coming — Gito is built to grow with your stack.

## 🔒 Security & Privacy<a id="-security--privacy"></a>

Gito keeps your source code private by design:
it is designed as a **stateless, client-side tool** with a strict zero-retention policy.

- **No middleman:** Source code is transmitted directly from your environment (CI/CD runner or local machine)
  to your explicitly configured LLM provider.
  If you use a local model, your code never leaves your network.
  We never see your code.
- **No data collection:** Your code isn't stored, logged, or retained by Gito.
- **Fully auditable:** 100% open source. Verify every line yourself.

## 🚀 Quickstart<a id="-quickstart"></a>

### 1. Review Pull Requests via GitHub Actions<a id="1-review-pull-requests-via-github-actions"></a>

Create a `.github/workflows/gito-code-review.yml` file with the following content:
```yaml
name: "Gito: AI Code Review"
on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize, reopened]
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      pr_number:
        description: "Pull Request number"
        required: true
jobs:
  review:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions: { contents: read, pull-requests: write } # 'write' for leaving the summary comment
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v7
      with: { fetch-depth: 0 }
    - name: Set up Python
      uses: actions/setup-python@v6
      with: { python-version: "3.13" }
    - name: Install AI Code Review tool
      run: pip install gito.bot~=4.1
    - name: Run AI code analysis
      env:
        LLM_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.LLM_API_KEY }}
        LLM_API_TYPE: openai
        MODEL: "gpt-5.5"
        GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        PR_NUMBER_FROM_WORKFLOW_DISPATCH: ${{ github.event.inputs.pr_number }}
      run: |
        gito --verbose review
        gito github-comment --token ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    - uses: actions/upload-artifact@v7
      with:
        name: ai-code-review-results
        path: |
          code-review-report.md
          code-review-report.json
```

> ⚠️ Make sure to add `LLM_API_KEY` to your repository's GitHub secrets.

💪 Done!  
PRs to your repository will now receive AI code reviews automatically. ✨  
See [GitHub Setup Guide](https://github.com/Nayjest/Gito/blob/main/documentation/github_setup.md) for more details.

Alternatively, install Gito locally and run `gito deploy` from your repository root.
The deployment wizard will guide you through setting up AI-powered code reviews and automatically generate or update the required workflow files. GitHub Actions and GitLab CI are both supported.
For GitLab, see the [GitLab Setup Guide](https://github.com/Nayjest/Gito/blob/main/documentation/gitlab_setup.md), or refer to the [GitLab workflow templates](https://github.com/Nayjest/Gito/tree/main/gito/tpl/workflows/gitlab) for manual configuration.

### 2. Running Code Analysis Locally<a id="2-running-code-analysis-locally"></a>

#### 2.1 Install Gito locally

> **Note:** If you use [uvx](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/tools/), you can skip this step.  
> When using commands like `uvx gito.bot setup`, `uvx gito.bot review`, uvx will install everything required on demand.  


**Option 1:** Install [gito.bot](https://github.com/Nayjest/Gito) using [pip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pip_(package_manager)).

**Prerequisites:** 
- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) 3.11 / 3.12 / 3.13  
- [Git](https://git-scm.com)

Run the following command to install the latest stable release from PyPI:
```bash
pip install gito.bot
```


> **Troubleshooting:**  
> pip may also be available via CLI as `pip3` depending on your Python installation.

To install from repository source / specific branch:
```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/Nayjest/Gito.git@<branch-or-tag>
```
**Option 2:** Windows Standalone Installer

Download the latest Windows installer from [Releases](https://github.com/Nayjest/Gito/releases).

The installer includes:
- Standalone executable (no Python required)
- Automatic PATH configuration
- Start Menu shortcuts
- Easy uninstallation

#### 2.2 Configure LLM connection

The following command will perform one-time setup using an interactive wizard.
You will be prompted to enter LLM configuration details (API type, API key, etc).
Configuration will be saved to `~/.gito/.env`.
```bash
gito setup
```
Alternatively, if you have `uvx` installed, you can run the setup command via `uvx`:
```bash
uvx gito.bot setup
```

> **Troubleshooting:**  
> On some systems, `gito` command may not become available immediately after installation.  
> Try restarting your terminal or running `python -m gito` instead.


#### 2.3 Perform your first AI code review locally

**Step 1:** Navigate to your repository root directory.  
**Step 2:** Switch to the branch you want to review.  
**Step 3:** Run the following command:
```bash
gito review
```

> **Note:** This will analyze the current branch against the repository main branch by default.  
> Files that are not staged for commit will be ignored.  
> See `gito --help` for more options.

**Reviewing remote repository**
```bash
gito remote git@github.com:owner/repo.git <FEATURE_BRANCH>..<MAIN_BRANCH>
```
Use interactive help for details:
```bash
gito remote --help
```

## 🔧 Configuration<a id="-configuration"></a>

Gito uses a two-layer configuration model:

| Scope | Location | Purpose |
|-------|----------|---------|
| **Environment** | `~/.gito/.env` or OS environment variables | LLM provider, model, API keys, concurrency |
| **Project** | `<repo>/.gito/config.toml` | Review behavior, prompts, templates, integrations |

> **Note:** Environment configuration defines external resources and credentials — it's machine-specific and never committed to version control. Project configuration defines review behavior and can be shared across your team.

### Environment Configuration

Environment settings control LLM inference, API Keys and apply system-wide.

Gito uses [ai-microcore](https://github.com/Nayjest/ai-microcore) for vendor-agnostic LLM access. All settings are configured via OS environment variables or `.env` files.

**Default location:** `~/.gito/.env`  
*(Created automatically via `gito setup`)*

#### Example
```bash
# ~/.gito/.env
LLM_API_TYPE=openai
LLM_API_KEY=sk-...
LLM_API_BASE=https://api.openai.com/v1/
MODEL=gpt-5.5
MAX_CONCURRENT_TASKS=20
```

For all supported options, see the [ai-microcore configuration guide](https://github.com/Nayjest/ai-microcore?tab=readme-ov-file#%EF%B8%8F-configuring).

#### CI/CD Environments

In CI workflows, configure LLM settings via workflow environment variables. Use your platform's secrets management (GitHub Secrets, GitLab CI Variables) for API keys.


### Project Configuration

Gito supports per-repository customization through a `.gito/config.toml` file placed at the root of your project. This allows you to tailor code review behavior to your specific codebase, coding standards, and workflow requirements.

#### Configuration Inheritance Model

Project settings follow a layered override model:

**Bundled Defaults** ([config.toml](https://github.com/Nayjest/Gito/blob/main/gito/config.toml)) → **Project Config** (`<your-repo>/.gito/config.toml`)

Any values defined in your project's `.gito/config.toml` are merged on top of the built-in defaults. You only need to specify the settings you want to change—everything else falls back to sensible defaults.

#### Common Customizations

- **Review prompts** — Tailor AI instructions, review criteria, and quality thresholds
- **Output templates** — Customize report format for GitHub comments and CLI
- **Post-processing** — Python snippets to filter or transform detected issues
- **Bot behavior** — Mention triggers, retries, comment handling
- **Pipeline integrations** — Jira, Linear, etc.

Explore the bundled [config.toml](https://github.com/Nayjest/Gito/blob/main/gito/config.toml) for the complete list of available options.

#### Example
```toml
# .gito/config.toml
mention_triggers = ["gito", "/check"]
collapse_previous_code_review_comments = true

# Files to provide as context
aux_files = [
    'documentation/command_line_reference.md'
]

exclude_files = [
    'poetry.lock',
]

[prompt_vars]
# Custom instructions injected into the system prompts
awards = ""  # Disable awards
requirements = """
- All public functions must have docstrings.
"""
```

## 🚧 Known Limitations<a id="-known-limitations"></a>

Gito cannot modify files inside `.github/workflows` when reacting to GitHub PR comments (e.g., "Gito fix issue 2").  
This is a GitHub security restriction that prevents workflows from modifying other workflow files using the default `GITHUB_TOKEN`.

While using a Personal Access Token (PAT) with the `workflow` scope would bypass this limitation, it is not recommended as a workaround.
PATs have broader permissions, longer lifespans, and are tied to individual user accounts, making them less secure than the default `GITHUB_TOKEN` for CI/CD pipelines.


## 💻 Development Setup<a id="-development-setup"></a>

Clone the repository and navigate to it:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Nayjest/Gito.git
cd Gito
```

<div><img align="right" width="460" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nayjest/Gito/main/press-kit/character/gito_fullbody_1.jpg">

Install dependencies:

```bash
make install
```

> **Note:** If `make` is not available on your system, you can run the underlying command directly:  
> `pip install -e ".[dev]"`  
> See the [Makefile](https://github.com/Nayjest/Gito/blob/main/Makefile) for all available commands.

Format code and check style:

```bash
make black
make cs
```

Run tests:

```bash
pytest
```
